a python-based programming method

The only thing available now is an interactive shell, and the only functions available are:

*<strong>class()</strong>, which returns the type;

*<strong>math()</strong>, which does math;

*<strong>exit()</strong>, which exits the shell;

<em>(Note that math() can only do the four basic operations with two numbers only;</em>

<em>there <strong>must</strong> be spaces before and after the operator)</em>
